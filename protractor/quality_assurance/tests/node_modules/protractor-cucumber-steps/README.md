## Installation
To install this package and add it to your package.json just run:
```
npm install protractor-cucumber-steps --save-dev
```

## Importing and enabling
This package is used as plugin with
[protractor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protractor) and
[protractor-cucumber-framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protractor-cucumber-framework).
It is quite simple to use - to get access to all Cucumber steps defined in this
plugin just:
- add the path to protractor-cucumber-steps in `cucumberOpts: {` `require: ...` inside `protractor.conf.js`;
- add the path to your page object file in `params: {` `pageObjects: ...` inside `protractor.conf.js`.

Here is a short config example for `protractor.conf.js`:

```javascript
exports.config = {
    // set to "custom" instead of cucumber
    framework: 'custom',

    // path relative to the current config file
    frameworkPath: require.resolve('protractor-cucumber-framework'),

    // require feature files
    specs: [
        'path/to/feature/files/**/*.feature' // accepts a glob
    ],

    cucumberOpts: {
        // require step definitions
        require: [
            './node_modules/protractor-cucumber-steps/index.js', // path to protractor-cucumber-steps
            'path/to/your/step/definitions/**/*.steps.js' // accepts a glob
        ]
    },

    // Custom parameters can be specified here
    params: {
        pageObjects: require('./page_objects/index.js') // path to your page object file
    }
};
```

## How to comment out a line in the feature file
You can add comments in `.feature` files using `#` for single line comments.
Multiline (or block) comments are not supported in Gherkin out of the box (see
https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin/issues/203), so you have to prefix all lines
with `#` like this:

```
# Test single line comment 1
# Test single line comment 2
Scenario: Commit to open source should be joyful
  When I commit
  Then I get a star
  # And a commented out step
```
